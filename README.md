# Heatmap-correlation-for-intradomain-species-count
This script can be used in R to calculate the most abundant species across sampling sites and determine if there are any correlations between these species. 
This script can be used for a single matrix of species count. There can be many domains, but in this case, it will only use the 15 most abundant species, regardless of their domain.
